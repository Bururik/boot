# Guestbook
#### Week 3 - Day 4.2

### Assignment
Create a small guestbook, using node.js, express.js, MongoDB and Jade.

###### The users of your guestbook should be able to
  - Sign the guestbook (req fields: name, email, message)
  - See everyone else that has signed the guestbook
  - Be able to link a specific note, using a unique id

###### In the backend
  - You should store your data appropriately in MongoDB
  - Every note should get a unique ID
  - You should use REST standards and you should have a clean API, ex:
    -  /guestbook/{id} - GET, POST, DELETE, etc.
    -  /guestbook

### Submission

Create a github repo called guestbook, and post the link to Slack.

```
https://github.com/{username}/guestbook
```
